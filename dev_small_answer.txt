S Though these products are highly sought-after and trendy , they are not the most essential things to people unlike healthcare products .

S For example , a person can lead his life peacefully without a laptop or hand phone , but , can a person survive happily with the absence of good health ?

S The answer should be 'No ' as health is the first priority in a person 's life .

S If a person is feeling unwell , he will have no mood to enjoy any other facilities and products .

S Thus , one current human need that should be given priority is nothing else than healthcare products .

S Among quite a number of healthcare products available in market , prosthetic limbs play one the most important roles .
A 15 15|||M:PREP|||of|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Prosthetic limbs are artificial legs or arms which replace the missing parts of the body .

S Losing a body part can make a person 's life miserable .

S They may lose not only mobility but also self-confidence .

S In this case , prosthetics limbs can help those disabled people to regain their mobility and confidence .

S So , designing the prosthetic limbs should be encouraged as it can really change a person 's life .

S According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
A 21 21|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When defining the problem , the cost , safety and liability , comfort , ergonomic and simplicity must be taken into account .

S For example , most of the disabled can not afford to spend a lot of money on those prosthetic limbs or some of them have an allergy to the materials used in the product .

S Before considering the possible solutions , we need to collect all the information that relates to the problem so that we can avoid redefinition and wasting time .

S After we confirm that the problem is real and a new solution is needed , we then proceed to step 3 in which we have to brainstorm the multiple solutions .

S In this step , we can do it in two ways : to improve the existing idea by finding out the weaknesses or to come up with a totally new and creative idea by researching and testing .

S Once we have alternative solutions to the design problem , we can analyze them and decide which one should be the most suitable for the needs .

S Finally , we can implement and test the design we have chosen and if we find any problems , we can go back to step 4 and select another solution .

S Well designed prosthetic legs can give a disabled person a new taste of life .

S According to the article about an amputee sprinter , Oscar Pistorius , who does not have both legs but wants to take part in 2008 Olympics with his J-shaped blades ( artificial legs ) made of carbon fibers , confidently said that " there is nothing he can not do that able-bodied athletes can do .

S In present days , engineers need to be creative and innovative in order to come up with new products .

S However , there are many problems that will hinder the engineering design process .

S We will focus our attention on the component decision process which will determine the type of raw materials to be used and the safety of the end product .

S The cost of raw materials has risen significantly from the year 2003 to year 2009 and it has affected the electronics supply chain .

S This results in faster operating speed and greater circuit integration .

S However , the price of copper has risen from about US $ 1900/tonne in June 2003 to about US $ 6200/tonne in June 2009 ( " Trend " ) .1

S When engineers turn to other types of cheaper materials , some functions and accuracy of the end product may be sacrificed .

S However , if the engineers were to stick to their original design , the cost of the end product will be high .
A 5 6|||R:VERB:TENSE|||are|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The high cost of the product may deter possible customers and in the end , the profit of the company will drop .

S Next we will look at product safety .

S The main idea of safety in a product is to ensure that the utilization of the product does not cause any injury or death to the user .

S One example would be the grounding of electronic devices .

S When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device .

S Social determinant in shaping nuclear technology

S Nuclear technology refers to technology that " involves the reaction of atomic nuclei " ( Wikipedia , n.d. ) .

S Yet , as a powerful technology , many applications of this technology have been limited due to political , environmental and economical factors .

S Like many other technologies , nuclear technology first came into use to meet military demands .

S Since nuclear weapons are of mass destruction , policymakers of countries all over the world prohibit research of nuclear technology 's application in military aspect and a non-proliferation treaty has been open for signature since 1968 ( International Atomic Energy Agency , 1970 ) .

S In conclusion , the engineering process for designing for innovations is greatly dependent on the availability of raw materials and funding .

S The delay or shortage in either of them will lead to a lapse or even stoppage of the designing process .

S The 'Made in China ' phenomenon has signaled China 's endeavor to catch up with the advanced western countries .

S However , the unprecedentedly rapid economic growth , driven by manufacturing and export industry , probably prevent people from discovering the problems that may impede engineering design process for innovation .
A 16 17|||R:VERB:SVA|||prevents|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Two of these problems involve the special political environment and Chinese people 's mindset , which already have negative influence on several stages of engineering design process for innovation in China .
A 10 10|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , the special political environment many account for the stall of some stages of the whole process , such as the stage of recognizing a need or problem and the stage of innovation-development .
A 12 13|||R:NOUN:NUM|||stalling|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On one hand , many old-style leaders have long been so satisfied with the annual double-digit economic growth that they tend to refuse to seek innovative factors to boost the economy .

S In fact , if we date back to the earliest related term in the party 's document , as it turns out , " it is not until October 2000 and the Fifth Session of the Fifteenth Party Congress that the 'cultural industries ' were formally proposed as part of the recommendations document for the national Tenth Five-Year Plan " ( Zhang Xiaoming , Hu Hulin and Zhang Jiangang , 2004 , as cited in Keane , 2007 , p.81 ) .

S On the other hand , for a system so guided by the central planning , having such decision makers means that it probably will have difficulty recognizing a need or a problem .

S Consequently , research and development ( R&D ) activities are not likely to be stimulated instantaneously .

S Even though R&D activities are somehow initiated successfully , the nature of central planning which calls for " information to be moved up and down the hierarchy " ( Chan , 2009 ) may throw obstacles in the information-exchange process , which is significant to the innovation-development process .

S Additionally , as Keane ( 2007 ) cited in his book 'Created in China ' , " socialism overplayed the role of productive forces and failed to develop the innovative potential of human capital " .

S For instance , Gage ( 2006 ) showed that in a case study published by the Washington Policy Centre , a non-partisan think tank , health facilities were required to get permission from the State Health Agency to build and extend their health care facilities .

S As it was unveiled in the research report , it somehow took longer for the health facilities to obtain approval from the State Health Agency than to actually build or extend the needed facilities .
A 1 3|||U:OTHER||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In truth , the hospital would not be allowed to renovate unless it discarded ten beds ( ) .
A 16 19|||U:PUNCT||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a result , the central planning actually created monopolies in this case , and the communication between manufacturing and supplier broke down due to such central planning interference .

S Thus , the demands of consumers and the free market could not be met .

S Another problem refers to Chinese people 's mindset .

S As Michael Keane ( 2007 ) has noted , the common assumption existing long among the Chinese was that productivity directly equals to material production .
A 22 23|||U:PREP||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " In other word , a focus on production and performance indicators in China had impacted negatively on innovation " .

S Therefore , even today in China , it is still reasonable to argue that the process for innovation may not be well understood , which means , in the respective of knowledge degree of technology transfer , the innovation-development does not seem capable to function well .

S Moreover , according to what E. M. Rogers ( 2003 ) stated in 'The Generation of Innovation ' , in the face of high degree of uncertainty , these social factors in innovation-development process determine what technology is actually available to the consumers .

S To sum up , we are all witnessing the state 's transformation from 'Made in China ' to 'Created in China' .

S In current stage , political environment and people 's mindset are two of the problems that may hamper engineering design process for innovation .
A 1 1|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , these problems already have impact on several stages of the process .

S Rogers ' first stage is needs or problems , which indicates the initial target or request of the whole research and development process .

S It is quite interesting that the initial researching target of the two products is the same : to create a more powerful and adhesive glue .

S However , it turns out later that the serendipitous discovery actually has no real target in this stage , because the real use of post-it note seems totally different from what it has been expected at the beginning .

S So we can conclude that , the serendipitous discovery and the normal one differ only in the first two stages of Rogers ' innovation process .

S And from the third stage onward , they seem to have no more obvious differences .

S In the context of the innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S Identify one important technology which was socially determined or shaped by a specific group of users and discuss how specific factors ( e.g. , economic factors , military demands , or government regulations/priorities ) have shaped this technological innovation .

S What is technology ?

S According to Roger ( 2003 ) , technology is a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome .

S In the context of innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view .

S All modern jet aircraft are powered by engines based on the first jet engine .

S This was first developed by Frank Whittle in 1937 and installed in military aircrafts during the World War II .
A 15 16|||U:DET||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After the war , this technology was transferred to commercial use and enabled faster and safer air travel .

S In the context of the social construction of technology , I will discuss how various social factors have shaped this technological innovation .

S Frank Whittle , the inventor of jet propulsion , was a pilot in the Royal Air Force in the early 1920s .

S When he first proposed the idea of turbo jet propulsion , it was met with skepticism by the Air Ministry and was denied assistance and funding from the country ( " Biography : Sir Frank Whittle , " n.d. ) .

S Frank Whittle then continued to work on his engine but due to lack of funding , he made little progress .

S Finally just a few months before the invasion of Poland by Germany and in the wake of possible threats , the Air ministry finally took Frank 's work seriously and promised funding in Frank 's research ( Younossi et al.,2003 ) .

S The social setting of the invention also plays an interesting role in shaping the history of jet engine .
A 16 16|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When Frank Whittle carried out his research for the British , a German physicist by the name of Hans Von Ohain had already successfully invented the jet engine and the first test flight was a whole two years earlier than Frank Whittle 's ( McTavish , 1993 ) .

S However Frank 's model was more recognized than Han 's due to two reasons .

S First , the first jet flight was unknown to the world due to military secrecy under the Nazi regime ( Crandall , 2007 ) .

S Second , the war ended with the Allies emerging victorious .

S Therefore , Hans 's engine was not developed while the U.K continued to improve on Frank Whittle 's design , which would later be evolved to commercial uses .

S In this case , the engine used was socially determined by the winning party of the war .

S Two feasible engines had meet up with different fate due to the different social settings .
A 8 9|||R:NOUN:NUM|||fates|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last by not least , the increase in the trends of international tourism is the one factor that allows jet engines to be converted to civilian usage today .

S After the war , peace returned and economy prospered due to reconstruction efforts .
A 7 8|||R:NOUN:NUM|||economies|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People became more affluent and demand for foreign travel increased exponentially ( Lyth , 1975 ) .

S Planes in use then were slow ; around 250 miles per hour , and the airlines industry needed a better alternative .

S This was when the jet engines were developed to fit into the commercial planes we travel on today .

S As we can see , a change in society trend can completely revolutionize the usage of a technology .
A 9 9|||M:NOUN:POSS|||'s|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is a striking example of how social factors shaped the way people use a technology .

S To conclude , the jet engine has come a long way .

S From its initial usage in killing machines to its function in revolutionizing air travel , the jet engine in use today has been shaped by many social considerations and I certainly believe it will continue to be so in the many futures to come .

A 2 3|||R:VERB:SVA|||hampers|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , a serious plagiarism problem of Chinese institutes and the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people are two significant restrictions for the innovation of engineering design in China .

S The plagiarism problem in both researching process and manufacturing process of engineering design is very serious in China .

S In Chinese universities and other research organizations , plagiarism is rampant .

S A Chinese study shows that " 60 percent of PhD candidates admitted to plagiarism , bribery " ( Marquand , 2006 ) .

S University professors are also exposed of plagiarism .
A 5 6|||R:PREP|||to|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , Wang Mingming , a sociology professor in Peking University plagiarized 100.000 words from an American anthropologist 's work in the year 2002 ( Academic Circles , 2002 ) .

S Plagiarism also exists in manufactories .

S A notable number of Chinese factories make piratical products by copying foreign products .
A 7 8|||R:MORPH|||pirated|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , Meizu , a Chinese electrical manufactory famous for its pseudo " Apple inspired design " music players recently comes up with a new product M8 .
A 21 22|||R:VERB:TENSE|||came|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This new product is actually another copycat of Apple iphone ( Ricker , 2007 ) .

S Another example is the popular Chinese website " Xiaonei " .

S It is exactly a fake " Facebook " .

S Plagiarism can have strong negative effects on the innovation of engineering design .

S By plagiarizing , engineers are not inclined to generate and analyze multiple solutions ( Khandani , 2005 ) .

S They tend to copy other engineers ' work and become less creative , which in turn , significantly hamper the engineering design innovation of the whole nation .
A 18 19|||R:VERB:SVA|||hampers|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The other important factor is the traditional conservative consumption concept of Chinese people .

S Chinese culture used to appreciate consistency and changelessness .

S In modern society , many Chinese people are still traditional and conservative in their consumption concepts .

S They tend to reject engineering innovation and be slow in accepting new technological products .

S Consequently , the conservative consumption concept can lead to low evaluation estimation of innovative products .

S For the famous Russian Anti-Virus software , Kaspersky , many Chinese people would prefer to get a free registration key than pay certain amount of money .

S Furthermore , the commercializing process of engineering design innovation can also be strongly affected by the conservative consumption concepts .

S Take " Xianjian ( the Legend of Sword and Fairy ) " , a fantastic Chinese video game for example .

S It is a very popular video game in china .

S However , the game company is lack of capitals for research and development since most players are using cracked version of Xianjian .

S With few responses from local consumers , it is really tough for the innovation of engineering design in China .

S The world is becoming more competitive .

S Only creative countries with innovative engineers can lead the technology of the world .

S Therefore , innovation in engineering design is of extreme importance .

S China has to be aware of its problems in engineering design in order to be a leading nation in the 21st century .

S By reducing the plagiarism rate of Chinese institutes and gradually converting the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people , China can really make a big difference .

S During the last decade , Vietnam experienced significant changes .

S In 1986 , the government of Vietnam introduced the " Doi moi " - reforming program to bring about improvements in the living of its people .

S Although progress has been impressive by almost any standards : economy , education , health service... , Vietnam must face a lot of current challenges , especially in technology .

S Among these challenges , the shortages of investment and skilled workers actually hamper engineering design processes for innovation .

S Problems in the Engineering Design Processes for Innovations in China

S Engineering design processes for innovations are very important to the industry of China .

S However , some existing problems hamper the innovations .

S Here , a make an example .
A 0 6|||UNK||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With the rapid development of the oil industry , the process and conveyance of oil is more and more advanced .

S Just at this time , a new kind of material comes into being which is called new plastic material .

S Compared with traditional metal conduit , plastic conduit has the advantages of lighter in weight , stronger ability to bear corrosion and smaller resistance .

A 8 8|||M:DET|||which|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Two significant problems are about the raw material and the utilization .

S Although the scale of the raw materials manufacture for the plastic conduit is extending and the quality of the materials is increasing , there are still some problems .
A 1 22|||UNK||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , there is little variety of the raw materials and there are almost no special materials .

S To meet the different needs of the market , many kinds of materials are needed .

S But , China does not have enough kinds of special raw materials at present .

S As a consequence , we need to import the materials from other countries .

S The import increases the price of plastic conduit which people do not want .

S Second , the qualities of the materials are not steady .
A 3 8|||R:OTHER|||quality of the materials is|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the special raw materials are very expensive , especially some accessories and some assistants .
A 14 16|||UNK||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a result , we need to import the special materials from other countries .

S Therefore , there are some problems about the raw materials of the plastic conduit that hamper the engineering design .

S Plastic conduit has its own characteristics .

S Special technique is needed , such as the technique of laying the conduit under the water and the repair skill .

S However , the criterions about these techniques are still under constituting .
A 3 4|||R:NOUN:INFL|||criteria|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 9 11|||UNK||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The study about plastic conduit is poor and there is no ripe method to construct .

S These problems lead to a result that although there are good products , plastic conduit can not exert its special functions because the workers do not have the necessary knowledge and still follows the outdated methods .
A 17 18|||R:VERB|||serve|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 32 33|||R:VERB:SVA|||follow|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a result , the laggard utilization of the plastic conduit hampers the process of engineering design .

S Plastic conduit is really an advanced design for industry .

S However , just like plastic conduit , there are many engineering designs which have not developed into perfect innovations in China because of the problems exist now .
A 25 25|||M:DET|||that|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To sum up , China has a long way to go to meet the needs of engineering designs processes for innovations .

S In the board sweep of scientific history , scientists have made a lot of discoveries via research .
A 2 3|||R:OTHER|||broad|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In contrast , a lot of serendipitous discoveries were made at the same time .
A 0 14|||R:OTHER|||At the same time , a lot of serendipitous discoveries were made|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a serendipitous discovery , the discovery of penicillin is very different from the discovery of the DNA 's structure , because Alexander Fleming started to study penicillin by an accidental finding , but Watson and Crick started the research on the DNA 's structure based on Franklin 's previous study .

S Furthermore , Fleming did not experience failure during the study on penicillin , but the discovery of DNA 's structure did not seem to be that smooth .

S The discovery of penicillin was started accidentally , but Watson and Crick started their research on the structure of DNA based on the previous research done by Franklin .

S Douglas Allchin ( n.d. ) once put in his article saying that " Alexander Fleming 's discovery of penicillin is one of the most celebrated cases of chance , or accident , in science ( Allchin , n.d. ) .

S " Although Louis Pasteur once said that " chance favors only the prepared mind " , it was fortune that have done the most job to make Fleming the person who found penicillin .
A 20 21|||R:VERB:SVA|||has|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Well , for Watson and Crick , it was another story .

S " These two brash young scientists " ( " The discovery of " , n.d. ) spent more than one year discussing the result of Franklin 's research and their assumptions before they really embarked on their own research .

S Maybe it was just because that Fleming discovered the penicillin by chance , he did not experience any failure during the discovering process , while the discovery of the DNA 's structure did not seem to be that easy and the process did not seem to be smooth , either .

S After " Fleming noticed a halo of inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mould on a Staphylococcus plate culture " ( " Discovery of penicillin " , 2009 ) , he started his research and discovered penicillin .

S Everything seems progressing normally .
A 1 2|||R:VERB:TENSE|||seemed|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 2 3|||R:OTHER|||to progress|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When it comes to the DNA 's structure , the situation was quite different .

S In the 1950s , not only Watson and Crick , but also two other groups were working on the research wanting to determine the structure of DNA , but in the end , only Watson and Crick were able to produce good quality diffraction patterns and thus produce sufficient quantitative data about the structure ( " History of molecular " , 2009 ) .

S In conclusion , scientists made new discoveries by using different methods .

S The discovering process of penicillin and the structure of DNA were totally different , but the scientists have made significant contribution to human beings by making both discoveries .
A 2 3|||R:NOUN:NUM|||processes|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Over the years , man has come up with many marvelous ideas and technologies which helped to simplify our lives by a huge leap .
A 15 15|||M:VERB:TENSE|||have|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These great ideas were thanks to the hardwork and effort that researchers put in to make them happen .

S However , some of the unthinkable ideas were not created through research .

S These creations are called serendipitous discoveries .

S Often than not , they are chanced upon when the researchers are researching on something else instead .
A 0 1|||M:ADV|||More often|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let us take a closer look at two examples , the electric car as technology that was developed via research and warfarin which was a result of a serendipitous discovery , and find out what are some of their similarities and differences in terms of their popularity , usefulness , production cost , and other usages .
A 54 55|||U:ADJ||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 55 56|||R:NOUN:NUM|||usage|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Both the electric car and warfarin gained in popularity from the moment they were developed .

S The electric cars were heavily marketed when the prototype became available .

S Advertisements were put up in each local newspaper , inviting interested individuals to apply for an opportunity to test-drive the new vehicle .

S The response turned out to be overwhelming .

S According to Rogers E.M. ( 2003 ) , in Sacramento , with a population of close to half a million , seven thousand applied .

S And though they were given thrity minutes after the test-drive to ask questions , they find that it was not enough to ask all the questions that they have in mind .

S Also , when asked to hand out wallet-sized cards containing information on the electric cars , the test-drivers did it with passion .

S They even asked for more cards when they finished giving out what they have .
A 13 14|||R:VERB:TENSE|||had|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As for warfarin , it was a big hit too as it was a very effective antidote against pests like rats and mice .

S However , to this date , it has been overtaken by another stronger poison called brodifacoum .

S This is because many rat populations have developed resistance to warfarin .

S Therefore , a poison of greater potency is needed .

S Another similarity between the two different innovations is that they are both useful in their own way .

S The electric car is created as it does not pollute the air unlike gasoline vehicles .

S The electric car is also lightweight and very quiet , which does not produce noise pollution as well .

S Therefore , the electric car serves its purpose of being a clean and pollution-free car .

S The warfarin is useful as rats causes a lot of problems especially to farmers , and warfarin is very effective against them .
A 0 1|||U:DET||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 6 7|||R:VERB:SVA|||cause|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , it is not dangerous to humans who might happen to consume it .

S Thus , both creations are very useful in the role they play in making our life a better one .

S One difference between the two innovations is the production cost of each product .

S The electric car is a large scale project where large amount of money is pumped into doing research in order to improve the car .
A 9 9|||M:DET|||a|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides that , each individual part that make up the car is also expensive .
A 7 8|||R:VERB:SVA|||makes|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As compared to the electric car , warfarin is a cheap product which is easily available in the market .

S Another consideration that separates the electric car from warfarin is that the electric car only has one usage whereas warfarin has other usages besides being used as a pesticide .

S The electric car is a vehicle used for transportation and that is its sole purpose .

S Warfarin , on the other hand , can be used as an anticoagulant .

S It is prescribed to people with an increased tendency for thrombosis , the formation of blood clot inside the blood vessel .

S Warfarin can also help to prevent formation of future blood clots .

S In conclusion , although technology can be created by means of doing research or by chance , there are still some similarities and differences between them .

S Conventional Way and Skunkworks

S Technology is a material object which is used to increase the ability to adapt to one 's environment ( " Technology , " 2009 ) .

S To produce technology , one has to make a project involving professionals .

S Because the project usually spends a lot of money , one should have a backup , such as a company , to give financial support .
A 4 5|||R:VERB|||costs|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conventional way , one should receive an approval from the corporate executives due to the company bureaucracy in order to do the project .
A 5 7|||R:VERB|||needs|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are some projects which are not approved by the corporate executives .

S Most people will just obey the decision .

S Nonetheless , there are some people who are not satisfied with the decision made by the corporate executives , and these people dare to challenge the executives ' decision by doing the project in a skunkworks environment .

S Thus , technology can be derived from a project which is done either in a conventional way or in a skunkworks environment .

S A conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment differ in organizational structure and time consumption , but similar in the doers and the purpose .
A 23 23|||M:VERB|||are|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One obvious difference is the organizational structure .

A 18 20|||R:OTHER|||they|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These people have to submit a proposal of the project and wait for the executives ' decision , which is based on the company situation .

S In some cases , although the idea of the project was brilliant , the executives rejected the proposal due to the economic situation of the company .
A 21 22|||R:ADJ|||financial|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , Toshiba 's corporate leaders denied Tetsuya Mizoguchi 's request on the laptop project ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S In contrast , a project which is done in a skunkworks environment does not undergo the company 's bureaucracy .
A 14 15|||R:OTHER|||go through|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In other words , the start of skunkworks does not depend on the executives ' decision .

S As a result of the difference in organizational structure , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment also differ in time consumption .
A 18 19|||R:VERB:TENSE|||is|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The project which is done in a conventional way needs more time due to the approval of the corporate executives .

S Consequently , the project which is done in a skunkworks environment consumes less time than the conventional one .

S This is why in 1943 , the Air Tactical Service Command ( ATSC ) of the Army Air Force gave Lockheed Aircraft Corporation a command to build a jet fighter due to the rapidly growing German jet ( " Skunk Works , " n.d. ) .

S Despite these differences , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment have two similarities .
A 12 13|||R:VERB:TENSE|||is|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , both of them are handled by professionals .

S Due to the complexity of the project , an unskilled person would not be able to do the project .

S Indeed , great success has been achieved , for instance Singapore 's clean water technology is widely recognized by the world .

S The large scale research and development effort has placed Singapore as the leader in new water technologies especially in membrane applications .

S Despite her huge success in many areas , Singapore does face problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovations .

S One problem faced by engineering design in Singapore is the various restrictions due to socio-political system of the country .
A 14 14|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Innovations are restricted by the many rules and regulations the country imposed , and sometimes the over emphasis of specific policies which causes development of ideas in an irrelevant area to be neglected .

S Singapore is renowned for her strict implementation of rules , and in times it may be seen as too inflexible .
A 11 12|||R:PREP|||at|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As such , innovations in the contentious areas are often restricted .

S The ideas eventually accepted are shaped primarily by commercial interests and governmental policies .

S In recent years , the core objectives of the country 's research and development project have been directed in the area of clean energy and water technology .

S This groundbreaking discovery also won Fleming a Nobel Prize .

S Therefore , the common factor of all technological developments is that they address existing social problems , in one way or another .

S However , there are still differences between an innovation that is developed via continuous research and one that is serendipitously discovered .

S These discrepancies can be further categorized in terms of their purpose , procedure and effect .

S The conventional innovation process requires the engineers to first identify a human need before the research officially begin .

S Its application is realized after the product has already been created .

S Alexander Fleming did not expect to discover penicillin mould when he left the petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture open .

S Therefore , an innovation involving continuous research and development differs from an accidental discovery as the former is a rational problem solving process while the latter is more of a lucky surprise .

S Apart from the difference in purpose , the conventional innovation products and the one serendipitously discovered also undergo different research and development procedures .

S The conventional products usually go through careful planning stages , making the whole development process well prepared .

S These innovations are usually backed by solid technological background , expertise and sufficient funds .

S GM allocated $ 2 billion for designing , manufacturing and marketing of their electric car IMPACT , after which expert diffusion scholars helped in campaigning for the product throughout the United States .

S Within one year , the first tier of cars was put into mass production .

S On the contrary , when Fleming discovered penicillin mould , he then had to refer his discovery to Charles Thom , an American specialist for further research .

S It took more than 10 years for penicillin to be eventually purified and applied to medical use .

S Lastly , the immediate effectiveness of a conventional innovation may be more conspicuous than that of a fortuitous discovery .

S The centralized research procedure gives engineers more careful thoughts in the development of a conventional innovation .

S The technological product created is thus more sophiscated and addresses human need more directly .

S On the other hand , accidental discovery may be too crude for actual application immediately .

S After Fleming had discovered penicillin , a series of specialists , including himself , had to carry out tedious research trials to further improve penicillin to ensure stable reaction on human bodies .

S In conclusion , technological products developed via research do differ from those serendipitous discoveries in terms of their purposes , research procedures and immediate effects .

S Despite of this fact , these products all serve to solve existing problems .

S Yet technological innovation is not like a lottery game .

S Instead , it should be a conscientious and exact pursuit of solutions .

S Although there are occasional lucky winners , engineers should still put in every endeavour in all research processes .

S Technological innovations shaped the modern lifestyle .

S Two problems in China that hamper engineering designing process

S Engineering designing plays a key role in technological innovation .

S According to Seyyed Khandani ( 2005 ) , engineering design includes creating technological products which have never existed before and improving the existing devices or systems .

S There are five basic steps for solving a design problem : define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution .

S Although the description of the designing process is simple and clear , the implement of engineering design is rather complicated and requires several crucial qualities .
A 13 14|||R:MORPH|||implementation|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Two of the most important qualities are creative thinking skills and intensive working habbit .

S However , two problems in China deprived them of these two qualities .

S First of all , Chinese education system largely destroyed students ' creative thinking skills .
A 4 4|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Inovative thinking contains natural curiosity and bold imagination whereas analytical thinking is comprised of experiences .
A 0 1|||R:SPELL|||innovation|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The schools in China usually aim at cultivating students ' analytical skills by teaching them knowledge and testing them on the knowledge been taught .
A 22 23|||R:OTHER|||that has been taught|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But the education system does n't encourage students to think out of the box to give their own answers or to explore the mysterious world .

S This " education for examination " strategy have two negative impact on engineering design .

S First , it prevents students from detecting real problems by themselves which is essential in the first step of engineering design .

S As the experiences filling up students ' minds , their curiosity is fading day by day until they do n't even bother to take notice the world surrounding them .
A 25 25|||M:PREP|||of|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , it limits the possible solutions students could come up with , therefore hampers the third step .

S Examination often denies imagination .

S Hence students gradually lose the ability to conceive fresh ideas .

S However , the best way to solve a problem may not be taught by lecturers and books .

S Sometimes , we need to use our own brain to find it out .

S Secondly , Chinese society destracted engineers from devoting into innovative work .

S In scientific world , most of the greatest contributers are from western countires ; the only two Chinese scientist who won Nobel Prize developed their theories in America .

S Saturday , September 5 , 2009

S In Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs , health clinches the second platform of the pyramid under the classification of safety needs .

S Health , good health in particular , is an important part of our lives .

S The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech gave immense significance to healthcare .

S With health being the subject of conversation in most places , it would not be wrong to classify good health as a need in today 's world .

S The measures taken to improve the healthcare system worldwide ranges from the fundamental implementation of affordable healthcare in poor countries to the more advanced introduction of stem cell research .

S With one notion of improving the healthcare system , man has even delved into surgery assisted by robots .

S Some might find this assisted surgery difficult to fathom while others might argue about the competency of such a system .

S Amidst all these opposition , the Da Vinci surgical system rose prominently from the California company intuitive surgical .

S This Da Vinci surgical system would not have been made possible without the engineering design process as described by Khandani .

S The engineering design process gears up with , first , defining and understanding a problem , The brainchild of the Da Vinci surgical system was the primary need to make the surgical process a less invasive one .

S To put it in better words , it was to reduce the size of incisions and to forego the need to crack bones or rib cages .

S The problem in this case is the intrusiveness of the surgical procedure on the human body .

S With the problem reinstated , it then becomes crucial to mark down the requirements towards accomplishing the design .

S However , as mentioned by Khandani , following the development of the design solution , these requirements will have to reviewed later .

S Initially , the requirements for this design to kick start were its effectiveness in performing surgery , its ability to be user-friendly and the capacity of it to work without posing potential danger to the patient .

S Overall , with the base of the design process carefully established , it would be easier to get to the imminent task .

S Following the defining of the problem was the task of gathering sufficient information .

S Lack of information would turn out to be potentially lethal to any design process and the Da Vinci surgical system was no exception to this .

S The spectrum of information was spread out in all ways , from the need to understand possible fallbacks in the design process to previous attempts at creating the surgical system .

S Khandani in his viewpoint mentioned various sources of information like the internet and library .

S Information , being a liabilty , will first have to be sourced out and then scrutinized to the minute details .

S With information as a good layback , the design can grace the next stage which is the formulation of many solutions to the problem .

S With concised understanding of the problem and important information , the design will move to the next stage of creating solutions .
A 1 2|||R:SPELL|||concise|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A single solution alone will not be able to suffice in making the design a roaring success .

S A good engineer will have to contemplate on various solutions and from various angles .

S After gathering various solutions to the problem at hand , Khandhani suggested narrowing down to one solution after considering the pros and cons of each solution .

S Making surgery less invasive could mean inventing other instruments but the reason a robot was chosen signifies the importance of surgery .

S The lives of patients can not be placed in jeopardy and inventing a design that comprises on safety of the patient was an absolute no .

S In the case of the Da Vinci surgical system , it will not be able to function unless it detects the presence of the surgeon 's head in the viewer .

S This was indication that the surgery was still in safe hands and was the best solution to making surgery less invasive .

S Therefore the solution was specified and the design process was nearing completion .

S Having a solution to the problem did not indicate a successful design process until the design was tested and implemented .

S This stage depicts the take off of the design for the first time after many trial attempts and failures .

S Khandani in his article mentioned four sub categories in the take off which are namely prototyping , concurrent engineering , documentation and applying for patents .

S A good engineer will have to consider these sub categories before his creation takes place .

S In context to the Da Vinci surgical system , take off of the system also meant clearance by the FDA .

S The FDA 's approval formed another sub category other than those mentioned by Khadhani in his article .

S July 2000 was a significant date in the history of the Da Vinci surgical system and was a mark that the world was taking the first step towards digital surgery .

S July 2000 was the date the surgical system could perform advanced surgical techniques .

S The opportunity to test and implement meant that the surgical system was ready to start its race in addressing health concerns .

S In conclusion , the need of the world and the attempts to address the need required one to go through an engineering design process .

S Health was the need in this case and the Da Vinci surgical system went through the design process .

S It is worthwhile to note how the healthcare system as a problem metamorphosized into the generation of solution in the name of the Da Vinci surgical system .

S The engineering design process as Khandhani clearly paints in his article is the guiding tool for various important inventions .

S Overall , the system is an effective design that has addressed the health concern of the world .

S In China , the worship of authorities is blind .

S Authorities are always right and can not be queried .

S This is also not good for people to design for innovation .

S To generate multiple solutions , it needs to try new ways audaciously .

S However , people always can not break the shackle of the authorities .

S They do not dare to challenge the authorities .

S This may owe to the class concept in China .

S Under shackles , no good ideas will be gotten .

S The blind worship of authorities also will hamper the academic exchange between the authorities and students .

S The electric car is an example of a socially determined technology , which came about due to factors from the different sectors of the society , such as the economy , government and the environment .

S In view of the rising fuel prices in the recent decade , car manufacturers have addressed the need to reduce costs in production , so as to be able to pass on minimal costs to the consumers , yet still remain competitive and appealing in the market .

S To invest , research and produce the electric car is a good deal in the long run , mainly because the car runs on electricity that is of a much lower cost than fuel .

S Furthermore , this would reduce the dependency on fuel in the future for cars , should one day the world has run out of fuel .

S With this in mind , the car manufacturer General Motors embarked on a $ 2 billion project on designing , manufacturing and marketing the electric vehicles in the early 1990s ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S They had received an overwhelming response from the masses to test-drive the new car when they launched their test-drive campaign .

S Mavens , who were specialists and consultants in their own field of expertise , were selected .

S They provided opinions and disseminating the information of the electric car to the larger market , which eventually boosted the total car sales of GM when they officially launched their first electric car into the market in the late 1990s ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S From the economic viewpoint , the technology of the electric car would benefit the manufacturers from the reductions of their production costs in the long run , and this would spur them on to increase their production with improved technology .

S One of the more outstanding features of an electric car is its non-polluting factor .

S With increased global warming and rapid emissions of greenhouse gases from factories and fuel-powered vehicles , there is an urgent need to reduce these emissions and the clean technology of the electric car is one of the solutions to address the environmental concerns .

S To invest in the green technology would therefore require a significant amount of financial resources , and to encourage continuation in this area of research , the government plays a role as a banker to grant incentives to these companies .

S In early August this year , US President Obama had announced that incentives of $ 2.4 billion are to be pumped into the development of the eco-friendly technology ( CNN.com , 2009 ) .

S With the financial aid from the government and the promising potential sales of the electric cars in the market , the car manufacturers are much complied to design , improve and thus , market these cars while the heat is still on .

S Even back in the 1990s , the government had already taken action to encourage the innovation of electric cars .

S The California and Arizona state governments had announced and made compulsory for 10 per cent of the total car sales in the market to be environmentally-friendly , so as to reduce the pollution levels in their states ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S Social construction of technology is also what called as the social determinist technology .

S The electric car is clearly an example of such technology because as early as 1990s , the environmental issues were already present such that the government had to take action to mitigate the situation .

S It was only due to economic reasons recently that the production of electric cars is stepped up .

S Behind the scenes , the birth of the technology of the electric car is primarily due to the society reasons then , and even till today , the electric car is constantly being re-designed and improvised with better technology so as to remain competitive in the market and most importantly , eco-friendly on the roads .

S Genetic material Samples are placed inside tiny vials , which then were put into numbered boxes with special code respectively .

S The temperatures of vats storing the species are normally adjusted to -160 to -18 degrees Celsius depending on different species .

S In the vats there is liquid nitrogen , but samples are perched above 20 centimeters of it to let the vapor , instead of the liquid itself cool and preserve the genetic information .

S As such , specimens can be perfectly stored for some 1000 years .

S However , can the problem of species extinction really be solved by this technology ?

S Since this particular technology came into being under the influence of human activities , it will definitely continue changing .

S In other words , when the technology becomes more mature and more profitable in the future ( which is very possible ) , it is very hard to guarantee that it will only be put into good use .

A 13 14|||R:VERB:FORM|||resulting|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , the invention of laptops and the discovery of 3M Post-it pads respectively .

S Laptops and Post-it pads are both favorable to us in one way or another .

S In the case where space constraint is of concern , laptops will be the solution .

S This is due to the fact that the size of laptops is much smaller than desktop computers as the latter consist of monitors as well as central processing units ( CPU ) .

S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , " the laptop made particular sense in Japan , due to crowded offices and small homes " .

S Similarly , the 3M Post-it pads are useful to us in our daily life .

S With Post-its , any notes , instructions or reminders can be written on it and attached to " a letter or other document " ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S Hence , both inventions are beneficial to us .

S The two technologies also possess another similarity , that is , they are both profitable .

S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , laptops demand increased from 5,000 units per month in 1986 to 100,000 in 1989 .

S Nowadays , laptops are still widely used all over the world by students as well as businessmen .

S This infers that laptops are doing well in the market .

S Likewise , Post-it pads are " one of the 3M 's most profitable products " ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S Thus , both the laptops and the Post-it pads are profitable .

S However , between these two technologies , one of their differences is how the idea came about .

S For invention of laptops , idea came about when there was a problem to be solved , which is , " due to crowded offices and small homes " ( Rogers , 2003 ) in Japan .

S On the other hand , for the 3M Post-it pads , the unexpected discovery came about when 3M researchers are investigating on a new adhesive ( Rogers , 2003 ) .

S For laptops , advancements are constantly introduced to attract the market .

S For example , there are faster processors and more internal memory space being incorporated .

S In addition to that , shrinking of laptops sizes and the variations of designs makes them even more attractive than before .

S There will surely be more enhancements to come in the near future .

S However , for Post-it pads , the developments are probably limited to colors , shapes , size and the extent of how sticky it is .

S Hence , in terms of future developments , laptops may have a better prospect as compared to Post- it pads .
A 14 15|||U:PREP||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , both technologies , which were either developed by research or by chance , have its similarities as well as differences .

S Although there are certain differences between them , the characteristics that both are profitable and useful in our daily life operation in one way or the other are important elements when developing a technology .

S Therefore , no matter whether the creation is based on research or luck , as long as it benefits us in one way or the other , it is a great invention .

S This year , the US Department of Energy , after a highly competitive application process , handed out US $ 400 million in grants to the 'Big Three ' - Chrysler , Ford and General Motors to develop next-generation technologies for electric vehicles ( Elie , 2009 ) .
A 38 38|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The vote of trust as shown by the Big Three 's initiative in developing this technology has provided a huge boost to the viability of electric cars replacing gasoline vehicles as the main mode of transport on the roads .

S Together with the strong backing of the government , it is exactly the type of stimulus that the electric vehicles require in order to make a strong and sustained headway into the automobile industry .

S US President Obama is expected to sign an order next month for federal agencies to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 ( Tim , 2009 ) .

S This is also reflected on a global scale , with major economies such as Russia , United Kingdom and China pledging to reduce their greenhouse gas emission within a similar time frame through carbon emission regulations and guidelines .

S Switching from gasoline vehicles to the 'zero-emission ' electric vehicles will significantly reduce the carbon emission of these countries , hence the resurgence of electric vehicles and their technology .

A 16 16|||M:PUNCT|||.|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , studies say that as much as $ 320 million will be spent on charging infrastructure over the next 20 years ( Peter , 2009 ) .

S Certainly , with more than one million electric cars on the road , charging infrastructure has to be developed and proliferated to meet the surge in demand for charging points .

S The global push towards the adoption of the electric vehicle technology is increasing in tempo .

S However , for it to replace the gasoline vehicles will be an uphill task that requires a concerted effort from both the industry and governments .
